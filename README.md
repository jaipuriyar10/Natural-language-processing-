All techniques related with NLP
This is basically a project based on classification,here I'm using SMScollection dataset consisting of 554 values from university of California dataset for training purpose,
i used different libraries of python for its implementation as pandas,regular expression,natural language toolkit,sklearn etc.The dataset is first preprocessed then only all the required algorithms 
are implemented on them.Finally the accuracy that i achieved is 98.56502242152466%.
